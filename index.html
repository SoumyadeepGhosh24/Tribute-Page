            <h2 class="title" id="title" style="text-align: center;">BOSE AND THE NEW SYNTHETIC IDEOLOGY OF SAMYAVADA</h2>
          <p>
            Netaji Bose, by his own admission in his book, “Indian Struggle”, (published in 1935) believed India needed a political system that was a mix of fascism and communism – which he called samyavad.
            As early as 1930, in his inaugural speech as mayor of Calcutta, he had first time expressed his support for a fusion of socialism and fascism.
            The Samyavada or doctrine of synthesis leads not only to socialism with due regard to national sentiment, but also it points to a perfect balance between the material and the spiritual, between the East and the West, between the past and the present.
          </p>

         <p>
            His social outlook was also based on anti- communalism and an adherence to the principles of rationalism. He visualized Indian society beyond the hidebound traditionalist caste and religious identities and sought the emergence of a modernist Indian identity which is thoroughly placed in the spiritual heritage of India (influence of swami Vivekananda).
